# Prediction model of stock price based on change of demand price elasticity 

Motivation：

If we can predict stock prices five days from now with appropriate data and algorithms, we will solve two very important problems in the investment market:

1.Give investor some useful suggestion in stock market
2.Calculate the probability of the prediction, and then use The Kelly Criterion to achieve better asset allocation

Goal:

Under the impact of big data, the investment decision-making is bound to change from the traditional human decision-making mode to the data decision-making as the assistant, and the fund manager will make the final investment decision according to the data processing results.

However, it is a very challenging job to predict the stock market by using big data. The purpose of this model is to try to build a relatively effective solution for securities market prediction.

Conclusion：

We can build a more effective prediction model by combining the relevant principles of finance and machine learning. This model can predict the price prediction of the stock market in the period of relative stagnation, which is a prediction model based solely on external factors. Although this method cannot completely predict the stock price in the whole cycle of the market, the algorithm iteration on this basis will gradually increase the corresponding variables to cope with the variable and weight ratio of securities price fluctuations in different markets and achieve a more rapid and effective prediction model.
